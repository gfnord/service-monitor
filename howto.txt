Simple monitor script written in python

./service-monitor.py <test-type> <server-info> <email-address>

	test-type    	tcp or http
	server-info  	hostname:port for tcp
	             	http://hostname/page for http
	label	  	label for the service
	email-address	username or username@domain.com

Just provide all 5 arguments to run the script. Simple like that.

Example:

./service-monitor.py tcp 10.5.1.1:9000 "PHP-FPM running on server01" youremail@example.com

The script will test if the port 9000 is open on server 10.5.1.1. If the port is open, nothing happens. If not,
you will receive an alert email.
